## Overview

This documentation describes the comprehensive data model used for male anatomical landmarks in our virtual clothing fitting system. The model defines a collection of precise measurement points that collectively enable accurate garment fitting in 3D environments.

## 1. Data Model Structure

The measurement system is built around a unified entity structure called `MeasurementPoint`. This is a flat model designed for performance and straightforward implementation, stored in a single database table. Each measurement point contains the following properties:

- `Id`: `Guid` - Unique identifier (UUID) that serves as the primary key for database storage and cross-system reference
- `Name`: `string` - English name of the anatomical landmark (e.g., `"Chest_Center"`, `"Waist_Center"`)
- `LabelTr`: `string` - Turkish label for localized UI display
- `X`, `Y`, `Z`: `float` (centimeters) - Float coordinates measured in centimeters, directly exported from the Blender scene
- `Category`: `string` - Measurement classification group (e.g., `"Primary"`, `"Secondary.Chest"`)
- `UsedIn`: `List<string>` (stored as JSON array) - List of clothing categories that utilize this measurement point
- `UsedFor`: `List<string>` (stored as JSON array) - List of measurement types this point contributes to
- `Gender`: `enum` ("Female", "Male") - Currently set to `"Male"`, with planned extension to support multiple gender options

The category field follows a dot notation structure (e.g., `Secondary.Chest`) for internal grouping purposes. Previous versions used slashes, which are now deprecated.

All clothing fitting calculations within the system refer to this standardized measurement model. The points are strategically positioned to capture essential body measurements necessary for proper garment fitting. The system uses these points to calculate circumferences, lengths, volumes, and other metrics required for accurate size matching.

### Supported Measurement Types

The following measurement types are currently supported in the `UsedFor` field:

```json
[
  "ChestCircumference", "WaistCircumference", "HipCircumference",
  "ArmLength", "InseamLength", "ShoulderWidth",
  "NeckCircumference", "ThighCircumference",
  "FootLength", "FootWidth", "Height"
]
```

These are the active metrics used by the male model. This list may evolve independently of the female version.

## 2. Storage & API Usage

### Database Implementation

All measurement points are stored in a single table named `MeasurementPoints`. This intentionally denormalized approach was chosen for several reasons:

1. Query performance: Retrieving all relevant points requires only a single database operation
2. Implementation simplicity: Reduces JOIN operations and complex queries
3. Maintenance clarity: Changes to the measurement system can be made in one place

For array fields such as `UsedIn` and `UsedFor`, data is stored as JSON arrays in the database, allowing for flexible addition of new clothing categories or measurement types without schema modifications.

### API Consumption

Client applications fetch this model data for various purposes:

1. **Visual landmark display**: Debug and fitting utility applications may render these points on 3D avatar models
2. **Measurement calculation**: Points are used to calculate distances, circumferences, and other derived measurements
3. **Validation**: Ensuring all required measurements are present for a particular clothing type
4. **Size recommendation**: Core logic for suggesting appropriate garment sizes based on body measurements

A typical API request might look like:

```
GET /api/v1/measurements?gender=Male
```

## 3. Applicability to Female Avatars

The model structure is shared between male and female versions to ensure consistency across the system. However, several key differences apply:

1. The specific landmark list differs to account for anatomical variations between male and female bodies
2. Coordinate values are based on male avatar reference models
3. Data for male avatars is stored separately with `Gender = "Male"`

This approach ensures that the system architecture remains consistent while accommodating gender-specific measurement requirements. In the future, support for non-binary or adaptive body categories may also be introduced. Future extensions may introduce additional gender options or more specialized measurement types for specific body types.

## 4. Example JSON Entries

Below are representative examples of `MeasurementPoint` JSON objects from the male model:

### Complex Example: Shoulder_Left

```json
{
  "Id": "5a9c1b3d-7e42-4f81-9d35-6c28a4e9f0b7",
  "Name": "Shoulder_Left",
  "LabelTr": "Sol Omuz",
  "X": 15.0,
  "Y": 6.5,
  "Z": 145.0,
  "Category": "Primary",
  "UsedIn": ["T-Shirt", "Jacket", "Sweater", "Coat", "Hoodie", "Blouse"],
  "UsedFor": ["ShoulderWidth", "ArmLength"],
  "Gender": "Male"
}
```

### Simple Example: Waist_Center

```json
{
  "Id": "2d7e6f9a-4b15-3c82-8d75-9e47a5b1c6f3",
  "Name": "Waist_Center",
  "LabelTr": "Bel Merkezi",
  "X": 0.0,
  "Y": 0.0,
  "Z": 105.0,
  "Category": "Primary",
  "UsedIn": ["Pants", "Jacket", "Shorts", "Underwear"],
  "UsedFor": ["WaistCircumference"],
  "Gender": "Male"
}
```

## Conclusion

The Male Measurement Data Model provides a robust foundation for accurate virtual clothing fitting. By standardizing the representation of anatomical landmarks, the system can reliably match garments to avatars across different applications within our ecosystem. The design balances performance considerations with flexibility for future expansions.
