## 1. üéØ Purpose

This document defines the **finalized MVP scope** of the TailorCore project. All features, limitations, and module boundaries are **strictly scenario-based** and locked for development. No component beyond this scope will be implemented.

The MVP is divided into two major operational layers:

- **User-Side Functionalities**
    
- **Admin-Side Functionalities**
    

Only these will be implemented. Any feature not explicitly defined here is considered **outside the MVP** and should be postponed to post-MVP discussions.

## 2. üß© MVP Structure Overview

- **Platform Type**: Local-Only Application (No Auth, No External API)
    
- **Supported Users**:
    
    - `female@tailorcore.com` ‚Üí Female avatar
        
    - `male@tailorcore.com` ‚Üí Male avatar
        
    - `admin@tailorcore.com` ‚Üí Admin interface only
        
- **No JWT, no security, no cloud storage, no login flow** (login is simulated only)

## 3. üë• User-Side MVP Features

### ‚úÖ Scenario-Driven Flow:

1. **Simulated Login**
    
    - Users select either Female or Male mode (no credentials)
2. **Mandatory Avatar Data Entry**
    
    - User must enter weight, height, age, and gender
        
    - BMI is auto-calculated and stored
        
3. **Avatar Creation**
    
    - Avatar is generated using the entered metrics
        
    - Age affects the body profile slightly
        
4. **Garment Selection**
    
    - User chooses a clothing category (e.g., T-Shirt, Pants)
        
    - Receives available garments via filtered view
        
5. **Garment Measurement Injection**
    
    - Garments are dynamically fit onto the avatar using measurement anchors
        
    - All measurements are calculated from the user's avatar data
        
6. **Wearing a Garment**
    
    - Garment is placed onto the avatar (single or layered)
        
    - Layering rules defined in the garment metadata
        
7. **Visual Feedback**
    
    - Color-coded fitting status (Green = Good Fit, Red = Tight, Yellow = Loose)
        
    - Includes real-time garment fit overlay
        
8. **Avatar Interaction Tools**
    
    - Zoom, Rotate, Walk cycle animation (looped)
        
    - Basic motion triggers (turn left/right, idle, walk)

## 4. Mobile-Side MVP Features

### ‚úÖ Android-Specific Implementation:

1. **Platform Specifications**
    
    - Android-only native application (iOS out of scope)
        
    - Built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose (no cross-platform frameworks)
        
    - Consumes identical backend API as web frontend
        
2. **Simulated Login**
    
    - Same user selection mechanism as web (`female@tailorcore.com` / `male@tailorcore.com`)
        
    - No real authentication (identical to web implementation)
        
3. **Avatar Creation**
    
    - Native input forms for required metrics (weight, height, age, gender)
        
    - BMI calculation performed client-side, identical to web
        
4. **Garment Selection and Management**
    
    - Native UI for browsing available garments by category
        
    - Same filtering capabilities as web interface
        
5. **Babylon.js Integration**
    
    - 3D rendering executed through embedded WebView component
        
    - WebView loads Babylon.js runtime for avatar and garment visualization
        
    - Same rendering pipeline and asset format as web frontend
        
6. **Real-time Visualization and Feedback**
    
    - Identical color-coded fitting status (Green/Red/Yellow)
        
    - Same avatar controls (zoom, rotate, walk animation)
        
7. **Data Synchronization**
    
    - Mobile app shares identical data models with web frontend
        
    - No offline persistence beyond local session state
        
    - Direct API consumption from backend services
        

### ‚úÖ Mobile-Web Feature Parity:

The mobile implementation maintains strict feature parity with the web frontend. Any feature available on the web will be available in the Android app, with adaptations only for form factor and input methods.

Mobile and web frontends are considered equal citizens in the MVP, both consuming the same backend services and visualization pipeline. The mobile app is **not** a future enhancement but an integral part of the initial MVP delivery.

### ‚úÖ Technology Boundaries:

|Component|Implementation|Limitations|
|---|---|---|
|UI Framework|Kotlin with Jetpack Compose|Android-only, no iOS or Flutter|
|3D Rendering|Babylon.js via WebView|No native OpenGL/Vulkan implementation|
|API Communication|Direct HTTP to backend|Same endpoints as web frontend|
|Asset Format|`.glb` (identical to web)|No mobile-specific optimizations|

## 5. üë§ Admin-Side MVP Features

### ‚úÖ Garment Lifecycle Management:

1. **Simulated Admin Login**
    
    - Hardcoded access to garment dashboard
2. **Garment Upload**
    
    - Admin uploads `.glb` files with required metadata:
        
        - Name, Category, Gender
        - Required Anchors with expected measurement values (in centimeters)
    - Clothing type is linked to measurement points (e.g., Chest, Waist)
        
3. **Anchor Point Definition**
    
    - Admin places anchor points on garments inside the Unity scene
        
    - Admin assigns a physical measurement value (in centimeters) to each anchor
        
    - This data enables garment-to-avatar fit evaluation
        
4. **Preview & Fit Testing**
    
    - Admin can apply garment on male/female test avatars
        
    - Internal check for fitting logic validation
        
5. **Publish / Unpublish Garments**
    
    - Publish makes garment visible for user-side selection
        
    - Unpublish = soft delete (still visible in admin panel)
        
6. **Unity‚ÄìBabylon Format Compatibility**
    
    - All garments must be uploaded as `.glb` (no format conversion step required)
        
    - Babylon directly loads `.glb`; Unity exports garments in the same format

## 6. üìê Measurement System

### ‚úÖ Universal MeasurementPoint Model:

All measurements are unified under a single domain entity: `MeasurementPoint`

|Property|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`Id`|Guid|Unique identifier|
|`Name`|string|English name of the anatomical point|
|`LabelTr`|string|Turkish label for UI|
|`X`, `Y`, `Z`|float|Coordinates in centimeters from Blender|
|`Category`|string|Group (e.g., Primary, Secondary.Chest)|
|`UsedIn`|string[]|Garment types using this anchor|
|`UsedFor`|string[]|Measurement types it contributes to|
|`Gender`|enum|"Female" or "Male"|

### ‚úÖ GarmentAnchor Model:

Garment anchors link specific points on garments to expected measurement values:

|Property|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`Id`|Guid|Unique identifier|
|`Name`|string|Name of the anchor point (e.g., "Chest_Left")|
|`ExpectedValue`|float|Expected measurement in centimeters|
|`X`, `Y`, `Z`|float|Coordinates in centimeters from Unity|
|`GarmentId`|Guid|Reference to parent garment|

### ‚úÖ Fit Status Evaluation Logic:

During virtual try-on, the system evaluates fit by comparing avatar measurements to garment expected values:

```
diff = avatar.measurement - garment.expectedValue
```

Based on predefined tolerance ranges, the system provides visual feedback:

- **Green**: Good fit (within tolerance range)
- **Yellow**: Loose (avatar measurement < garment measurement - tolerance)
- **Red**: Tight (avatar measurement > garment measurement + tolerance)

### Female and Male datasets are separated but follow the same structure.

Stored in a single table named `MeasurementPoints`.
