## 1. Purpose

TailorCore is an innovative digital fitting platform that enables users to create virtual avatars based on their personal body measurements and try on various garments in a virtual environment. The platform provides real-time fit feedback by comparing user body measurements with expected garment measurements, showing how garments will fit with color-coded visual cues.

This MVP (Minimum Viable Product) aims to transform the clothing shopping experience by enabling digital fit assessment before physically trying on garments in the real world. TailorCore bridges the gap between traditional retail and e-commerce by providing users with confidence about how garments will fit their unique body shape.

## 5. Measurement System Overview

The measurement system is the core of TailorCore's fitting functionality, built around two key concepts:

### MeasurementPoint

- Represents anatomical points on the avatar's body
    
- Contains X, Y, Z coordinates in centimeters
    
- Categorized by body region and gender
    
- Used to calculate avatar's measurements
    

### GarmentAnchor

- Represents specific points on garments with expected measurements
    
- Links garment locations to expected measurement values
    
- Allows comparison between avatar and garment measurements
    

### Fit Evaluation Logic

The system evaluates fit by comparing avatar measurements to expected garment values:

```
diff = avatar.measurement - garment.expectedValue
```

Based on the difference and predefined tolerance ranges, fit status is determined:

- **Green**: Good fit (within tolerance range)
    
- **Yellow**: Loose (avatar measurement < garment measurement - tolerance)
    
- **Red**: Tight (avatar measurement > garment measurement + tolerance)
    

## 6. Rendering Workflow

### Web Rendering

- Babylon.js renders both avatar and garments in the browser
    
- Real-time visualization of garment application on avatar
    
- Color-coded feedback overlay shows fit quality
    
- Interactive controls for zoom, rotation, and animation
    

### Mobile Rendering

- Babylon.js embedded in WebView component
    
- Same rendering pipeline and assets as web version
    
- Native UI for controls and user input
    
- Optimized for touch interaction
    

### Unity Workflow

- Unity Editor tools for garment preparation
    
- Anchor point placement with measurement value assignment
    
- Direct export to GLB format compatible with Babylon.js
    
- Test avatars for fit validation before publishing
    

## 7. Design Principles

### Clean Architecture

- Domain-driven design with clear separation of concerns
    
- Concentric layers with dependencies pointing inward
    
- Business rules isolated from technical implementations
    

### CQRS Pattern

- Separation of command and query responsibilities
    
- Commands for state changes, queries for data retrieval
    
- Explicit use cases with single responsibility
    

### MVP Constraints

- Local-first implementation without cloud dependencies
    
- No authentication or authorization (simulated login only)
    
- No external integrations or third-party services
    
- All measurements in centimeters, aligned with Blender avatar scale
    

## 8. Target Users

For the MVP, only three predefined users exist:

- `female@tailorcore.com` → Accesses female avatar features
    
- `male@tailorcore.com` → Accesses male avatar features
    
- `admin@tailorcore.com` → Accesses administrative interface
    

These users provide a simplified testing environment with hardcoded scenarios, enabling development and validation of core features without the complexity of user management.

## 9. Data Flow Summary

TailorCore’s local-first architecture ensures seamless flow from user input to visual garment fitting without any cloud or auth dependencies. Below is a typical end-to-end flow for a garment try-on scenario:

1. **User Input**
    
    - User selects either male or female mode (simulated login)
        
    - Enters height, weight, age, and gender
        
2. **Backend Handling**
    
    - API receives input → triggers `CreateAvatarCommand`
        
    - Application layer orchestrates avatar creation, calculates BMI
        
    - Avatar and `MeasurementPoints` are stored in PostgreSQL
        
3. **Garment Selection**
    
    - User browses available garments (filtered by category and gender)
        
    - On selection, garment metadata and `GarmentAnchors` are fetched via API
        
4. **Measurement Matching**
    
    - For each anchor, the system compares avatar measurement to garment’s expected value
        
    - A fit status is computed (Green, Yellow, Red)
        
5. **Rendering & Feedback**
    
    - Babylon.js visualizes avatar and garment in real-time
        
    - Anchor-based fit feedback is color-coded and overlaid
        
    - Mobile version uses the same pipeline inside WebView
        
6. **Admin Workflow**
    
    - Admin uses Unity tools to upload `.glb` garments
        
    - Defines anchors + expected values
        
    - Publishes garment for user-side try-on
